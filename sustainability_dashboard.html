The committee proposes amending the Companies Act to make ESG a core duty of directors, deploying forensic experts, issuing sector‑specific guidelines and imposing stricter penalties for false ESG claims.  The Securities and Exchange Board of India requires the top 1,000 listed companies to report ESG performance using the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) framework, which aligns with GRI and SASB standards.</td></tr>

The standard offers science‑based guidance for banks, asset owners, asset managers and private equity firms to align lending, investment, insurance and capital markets activities with a 1.5 °C pathway, setting a clear route to net‑zero by 2050.  It emphasises portfolio alignment and encourages financial institutions to support high‑emitting sectors in decarbonising, while integrating the guidance into existing risk and investment processes.</td></tr>

Smaller companies (0.5–1 trillion yen) will be considered later.  The roadmap emphasises phased implementation and notes that third‑party assurance will start from FY 2028.</td></tr>
